# STATIC

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).

Tyler's Note
>This is where the NetlifyCMS configuration and portal resides--they're inside
the `admin` folder. Note that one of the content types specified in the `.yml`
file there is 'Site Info'. It allows the site information (in this case, the
name and description) to be edited using NetlifyCMS! ðŸ˜Ž
