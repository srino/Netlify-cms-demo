# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

Tyler's Note:
> All I did in this directory was change the logo component (part of the Nuxt
scaffolding) to not be animated. It was distracting. ðŸ™‚
