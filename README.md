# âš  DEPRECATED - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE âš 
This boilerplate uses an older version of Nuxt and some now-unnecessary techniques, like loading content into a Vuex store. I recommend using [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) instead. Check out [the docs](https://content.nuxtjs.org/fetching) to see how loading content with `@nuxt/content` works. Once you have your website displaying content, use the [NetlifyCMS Docs]() to configure NetlifyCMS to allow you to edit that content.

If you would like to update this repository to use `@nuxt/content`, please feel free to open a PR. ðŸ™‚

## Nuxt NetlifyCMS Boilerplate

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/tylermercer/nuxt-netlifycms-boilerplate)

Live demo [here](https://nuxt-netlifycms-boilerplate.netlify.com/).

I wanted to build a website with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) but couldn't find any simple, well-documented templates that worked with the latest version of Nuxt, so I built my own! I hope you find it useful. ðŸ™‚

Many thanks to [Jake 101](https://jake101.com/), whose [Bael Template](https://github.com/jake-101/bael-template) served as a useful reference point as I built this.

**To-Do:**

* Add examples for the "Page" content type
* Add an example of using dynamic layouts in Nuxt, e.g. a dedicated layout for mobile
* Add an example of using Netlify-enabled forms
